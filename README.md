In this updated code:

    The User class and its references are removed.
    Functions read_users_from_file and write_user_to_file are added to handle reading and writing user credentials from a text file.
    The login functionality is modified to check the credentials from a text file instead of the database.

Make sure to create a users.txt file with initial user credentials in the format username,password before running this app.
